**Heading:** (e) A commits house -trespass by entering Z's house through the door having lifted a latch by 

**Content:** The concept of "breaking open zenana" is addressed in the context of the Code of Criminal Procedure, particularly in sections related to arrest and search procedures. Here are the key points:

1. **Procedure for Entry**: If a police officer or any person authorized to make an arrest needs to enter a place where the person to be arrested is believed to be, they must first demand admittance. If admittance is not granted, they are authorized to break open any outer or inner door or window to effect an entrance.

2. **Special Consideration for Zenana**: There is a specific provision for apartments occupied by women who, according to custom, do not appear in public. Before entering such an apartment, the police officer or authorized person must give notice to the woman that she is at liberty to withdraw and afford her every reasonable facility for withdrawing. Only after this can they break open the apartment and enter it.

This provision is designed to respect the privacy and cultural sensitivities of women in such situations while still allowing for the necessary legal actions to be taken.

Query: How does the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, address the issue of res judicata, and what are the conditions under which a court may refuse to try a suit based on this principle?
Response:
**Heading:**  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  

**Content:** The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, addresses the issue of res judicata through Section 11, which embodies the doctrine of res judicata or the rule of conclusiveness of judgment. Here are the key points and conditions under which a court may refuse to try a suit based on this principle:

### Key Points of Res Judicata under Section 11 of CPC

1. **Definition and Purpose**:
   - Res judicata means "a matter adjudged" or "a thing judicially acted upon or decided by judgment." The purpose is to give finality to judicial decisions and prevent endless litigation over the same issue.

2. **Conditions for Applying Res Judicata**:
   - For the principle of res judicata to apply, the following conditions must be met:
     - **Same Matter in Issue**: The matter directly and substantially in issue in the succeeding suit must be the same as the matter directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit.
     - **Same Parties**: The prior litigation must have been between the same parties or parties claiming under them.
     - **Same Title**: The parties must be litigating under the same title in both the former and subsequent suits.
     - **Competent Jurisdiction**: The court that decided the former suit must have had jurisdiction to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which the issue has been raised.
     - **Heard and Finally Decided**: The matter in issue must have been heard and finally decided by the former court.

3. **Essential Elements**:
   - The doctrine applies to various types of proceedings, including civil suits, execution proceedings, taxation matters, industrial adjudication, and administrative orders.
   - It ensures that once a matter is finally settled by a competent court, no party can reopen it in a subsequent litigation.

4. **Public Policy and Judicial Maxims**:
   - The principle is based on public policy and three key maxims:
     - **Nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa**: No man should be vexed twice for the same cause.
     - **Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium**: It is in the interest of the state that there should be an end to litigation.
     - **Res judicata pro veritate accipitur**: A judicial decision must be accepted as correct.

### Conditions for Refusing to Try a Suit

A court may refuse to try a suit based on the principle of res judicata if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. **Previous Final Decision**:
   - The matter in issue must have been previously decided by a competent court.

2. **Same Parties and Title**:
   - The parties in the subsequent suit must be the same or claim under the same title as in the previous suit.

3. **Competent Jurisdiction**:
   - The previous court must have had the jurisdiction to decide the matter.

4. **Matter Heard and Decided**:
   - The matter must have been heard and finally decided by the previous court.

5. **No Appeal or Further Litigation**:
   - The decision must be final, either because no appeal was taken, the appeal was dismissed, or no appeal lies.

If these conditions are met, the court will apply the principle of res judicata and refuse to try the suit, thereby preventing repetitive litigation and ensuring finality to judicial decisions.

Query: Punishment that are above 5 years
Response:
**Heading:**   

**Content:** To identify punishments that exceed five years, we need to look at various legal frameworks and statutes. Here are some examples from federal laws in the United States:

1. **Firearm-Related Offenses**:
   - Under 18 U.S. Code § 924, certain violations can result in imprisonment exceeding five years. For instance:
     - Using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime can result in an additional five years of imprisonment. If the firearm is a machinegun, destructive device, or equipped with a silencer, the sentence can be up to thirty years. For second or subsequent convictions, the sentence can be up to life imprisonment.

2. **Drug Trafficking Offenses**:
   - Federal trafficking penalties for various drugs can result in sentences far exceeding five years. For example:
     - For cocaine (Schedule II), the first offense for 500-4999 grams can result in a sentence of not less than five years and not more than forty years. For larger quantities or subsequent offenses, the sentences can be even more severe, including life imprisonment in some cases.

3. **Sentencing Guidelines**:
   - The federal sentencing guidelines provide for sentences that can significantly exceed five years based on the offense level and the defendant's criminal history. For example, a defendant with an offense level of 30 and a criminal history category of II could face a guideline range of 108 to 135 months (9 to 11.25 years).

These examples illustrate that punishments for various federal offenses can indeed exceed five years, often significantly so, depending on the nature of the crime and the defendant's prior convictions.

Query: What is the difference between CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, Code of criminal procedure and PAKISTAN PENAL CODE
Response:
The differences between the Code of Civil Procedure, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Pakistan Penal Code lie in their purposes, scopes, and the types of cases they govern.

### 1. **Code of Civil Procedure**
   - **Purpose**: The Code of Civil Procedure deals with the rules and procedures for conducting civil cases. These cases typically involve disputes between individuals, organizations, or entities where one party seeks compensation, property, or other remedies from another.
   - **Scope**: It covers various civil disputes such as contract disputes, property disputes, family law issues, and torts. The primary goal is to resolve private disputes and provide remedies to the injured parties.
   - **Key Features**: In civil cases, the plaintiff files a lawsuit against the defendant. The burden of proof is generally lower than in criminal cases, often requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Civil courts can order monetary compensation, property return, or other non-punitive remedies.

### 2. **Code of Criminal Procedure**
   - **Purpose**: The Code of Criminal Procedure outlines the rules and procedures for conducting criminal cases. These cases involve actions that are considered harmful to society as a whole, and the state or government prosecutes the defendant.
   - **Scope**: It governs the process from the arrest and charging of a suspect to the trial and sentencing. Criminal cases are categorized into felonies, misdemeanors, and infractions, each with different levels of severity and corresponding punishments.
   - **Key Features**: In criminal cases, the government prosecutes the defendant. The burden of proof is higher, requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The primary goal is to punish the offender, and the defendant has various constitutional protections, including the right to a fair trial and legal representation.

### 3. **Pakistan Penal Code**
   - **Purpose**: The Pakistan Penal Code is a substantive law that defines and prescribes punishments for various crimes. It is not a procedural code but rather a codification of criminal offenses and their corresponding penalties.
   - **Scope**: It lists the different types of crimes, such as homicide, theft, and assault, and specifies the punishments for each. The Code is used in conjunction with the Code of Criminal Procedure to determine the appropriate charges and penalties for criminal offenses.
   - **Key Features**: The Pakistan Penal Code focuses on the definition and classification of crimes and the penalties associated with them. It does not deal with the procedural aspects of how these crimes are investigated, tried, or punished, which is the domain of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

### Summary
- **Civil Procedure**: Deals with private disputes, lower burden of proof, and focuses on compensation or other remedies.
- **Criminal Procedure**: Deals with crimes against society, higher burden of proof, and focuses on punishment.
- **Pakistan Penal Code**: Defines crimes and their punishments, used in conjunction with the Code of Criminal Procedure.
